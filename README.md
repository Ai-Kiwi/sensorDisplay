# caution about downloading
Due to how new this project is, I still haven't worked out many different aspects of the communication standards between the server and client, so until later versions when I've created a format for delivering messages that won't break every update, you'll have to update both your server software and firmware. Additionally, there is no automatic update, thus this must be done by hand.
